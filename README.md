# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].

1. Software engineering is the application of engineering principles to the design, development, maintenance, testing, and evaluation of software and systems that make software operational.
2. Software engineering differs from traditional programming in the following ways;
1 Traditional programming focuses on writing code to solve specific problems while software engineering included analysis, design, development testing and deployment of complex systems
2. Methodology for the former is limited to informality with adhoc processes while for the later, it employs formalized processes like Agile and Waterfall with extensive documentation

SDLC phases;

Planning:

Define project goals and objectives.
Assess feasibility and resources.
Create a project plan and timeline.
Requirements Analysis:

Gather and document user and system requirements.
Create requirement specifications.
Identify stakeholders and their needs.

Design:

Design system architecture and components.
Create detailed design documents.
Plan the database, user interface, and other system elements.

Implementation (Coding):

Convert design specifications into code.
Use appropriate programming languages and tools.
Develop the software in modules or units.

Testing:

Conduct unit testing, integration testing, and system testing.
Identify and fix defects or bugs.
Ensure the software meets the specified requirements.

Deployment:

Install and configure the software in the target environment.
Conduct user training and support.
Roll out the software to end-users.

Maintenance:

Monitor and fix issues post-deployment.
Perform updates and enhancements.
Ensure long-term functionality and performance.

Key Differences Summarized:
Agile is adaptive, iterative, and customer-centric, allowing for continuous feedback and incremental improvements.
Waterfall is a structured, linear approach that emphasizes thorough planning and documentation before moving sequentially through phases.
Key Similarities:
Both aim to deliver high-quality software that meets user needs.
Both require thorough understanding and planning at the outset, though Agile is more flexible in handling changes.

Requirements engineering is a systematic process involved in defining, documenting, and maintaining the requirements for a software system.
